# gcode
Implement a program that reads the attached G-Code program from a file and parses the instructions. 

The programm can read gcode file and interpret in normal language.

The progamm is simple and is expected to be able to interpret simple gcode programm. 

Room for development in the code is relatively alright due to shortage of time. 

Gcode Commands that can now be interpreted in the programm are:

T01; M03, 05, 06, 09; G00, 01, 54, 90, 91, 28; Sx; Fx; X; Y; Z
